      The Instrument Rating (IFR) course at FlyTech Flight School is designed for pilots looking to enhance their flying abilities and operate safely in low-visibility conditions.

      By the end of this program, you will be proficient in instrument flight techniques, holding patterns, approach procedures, and emergency protocols. Our expert instructors will ensure that you develop the skills and confidence to pass the FAA Instrument Rating checkride and safely operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).`,
