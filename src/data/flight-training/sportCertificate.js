    description: `
      Introduced in 2004, the Sport Pilot Certificate is a streamlined FAA license designed for those who want to fly small, lightweight aircraft for fun or personal travel. It’s a great option if you're looking for a faster, more affordable path to the skies,without compromising safety or enjoyment.

      Sport pilots are limited to flying aircraft with no more than two seats and a maximum takeoff weight under 1,320 lbs. The training requires fewer hours than a traditional Private Pilot certificate and can often be completed without an FAA medical certificate,just a valid U.S. driver’s license is enough.

      FlyTech’s Sport Pilot program covers all FAA-required dual and solo flight time, cross-country navigation, and checkride preparation,getting you safely and confidently into the air.`,
