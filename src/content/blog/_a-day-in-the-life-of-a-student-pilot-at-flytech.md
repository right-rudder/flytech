Behind every pilot license is a daily routine built on structure, discipline, and hands-on learning. At Flytech Pilot Academy, students follow a clear and engaging schedule that prepares them for every stage of their aviation careers.

## Morning: Ground School and Briefings

Each day begins with classroom instruction covering topics like meteorology, navigation, and flight planning. Students review checklists and receive pre-flight briefings with their instructors to prepare for their training flights.

## Midday: Flight Operations

Students then move to the flight line, perform aircraft inspections, and take to the skies for their scheduled training flights. Each session is designed to build technical skills, confidence, and situational awareness.
