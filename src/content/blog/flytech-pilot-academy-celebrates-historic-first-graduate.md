“Seeing our very first student earn his wings is a momentous occasion for everyone at FlyTech,” said Lute Atieh, Co-Founder at FlyTech Pilot Academy. “We founded the academy to give aspiring pilots a modern, comprehensive approach to flight training. Today’s milestone exemplifies our commitment to helping each student reach their highest potential.”

Since opening its doors, FlyTech has emphasized an immersive learning experience that combines advanced flight simulators, cutting edge avionics, and one-on-one coaching. Students train on a cutting edge aircraft (Sling NGT) under the guidance of experienced Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs), ensuring a well-rounded skillset and thorough preparation for FAA certification exams.

“I’m incredibly grateful to FlyTech for providing such a supportive, challenging, and rewarding environment,” shared Kolin, FlyTech’s newly minted graduate. “There’s nothing quite like the feeling of taking off by yourself and confidently touching the ground at the end of a solo flight. I’m excited to put these new skills into practice as I continue my career in aviation.”

FlyTech’s success demonstrates the growing demand for high-quality pilot training programs. With airlines experiencing a global pilot shortage, the academy aims to equip students with not only the technical abilities essential for flying but also leadership and decision-making skills to excel in a competitive industry.
