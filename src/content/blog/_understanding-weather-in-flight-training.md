Weather is one of the most important factors in aviation, shaping how flights are planned, executed, and managed. At Flytech Pilot Academy, understanding weather patterns and decision-making is built into every stage of the training process.

## Ground School: The Foundation of Weather Knowledge

Students begin by learning the fundamentals of meteorology, including how to read weather reports, forecasts, and radar imagery. This foundation enables them to anticipate and plan for changing conditions.

## In-Flight Experience

Real-world training gives students hands-on experience in adapting to dynamic weather situations. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, they learn how to make safe, informed decisions in variable conditions.
