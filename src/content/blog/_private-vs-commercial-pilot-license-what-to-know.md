Aspiring pilots often ask what separates a Private Pilot License (PPL) from a Commercial Pilot License (CPL). Understanding the difference between these certifications is crucial for planning your aviation career.

## Private Pilot License (PPL)

A PPL allows you to act as the pilot in command of an aircraft for personal and recreational purposes. Training focuses on fundamental skills, navigation, flight maneuvers, and airspace knowledge.
