MCX Full Motion Simulator
FlyTech recently welcomed access to a full motion simulator thanks to a partnership with Hillyard Tech, St. Joseph MO.

The experience gained in our simulators, classrooms and cockpit empowers our students with unwavering calmness and composure needed for all situations, from the everyday to the unusual.

Flight training in a sim allows pilots to practice difficult maneuvers. You can teach yourself and expand on lessons. Also, you can simulate flight at airports all around the world.

MCX

Motion For Everyone
The Redbird MCX comes equipped with our innovative, 3-axis, electric motion platform. This one-of-a-kind system provides effective motion feedback for yaw, pitch, and roll. The system is clean and quiet enough to operate in a small classroom, but robust enough to stand-up to years of hard use in a large professional pilot academy.

Immersive Visuals
In the past, simulators have been used almost exclusively for instrument instruction and a single screen was all you needed to show the runway when the student broke out at minimums. But why limit your customers’ training and your profit if you don’t have to? The Redbird MCX is a great primary training platform, thanks in large part to its expansive visual displays. You can still put’em in the soup if needed, but accurately simulating VFR flights opens up a huge range of uses for the MCX. Let a student practice turns-around-a-point or show them the highway they’ll pass over on their long cross-country. With a world-wide terrain database to support the 200° visuals, the MCX lets your customers experience the view from the cockpit before they ever leave the ground.

Redbird C172-S
The Redbird C172-S simulator delivers a highly realistic flight training experience, replicating the renowned Cessna 172 Skyhawk. With advanced technology and high-fidelity simulation, it offers accurate flight dynamics, cockpit controls, and avionics. Ideal for practicing a range of scenarios, the Redbird C172-S provides a cost-effective, versatile tool for both student pilots and experienced aviators, enhancing training with immersive, intuitive interactions.

The Sling NGT, manufactured by Sling Aircraft (PTY) Ltd, is a cutting-edge Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) equipped with a ROTAX 912 IS engine. This 2023 model, registered as N900FT, is proudly owned by Fly Tech Aviation Academy LLC, based in Saint Joseph, Missouri.

Designed with state-of-the-art technology, the Sling NGT features a premium Garmin avionics suite, including a 10” G3X Touch primary flight display (PFD), an optional second multifunction display (MFD), a G5 backup flight display, and a GTX45R ADS-B In/Out transponder providing real-time traffic and weather data. It also boasts a GTN 650 Xi GPS/NAV/COMM/MFD navigator and an autopilot system with a GMC507 control panel, making it one of the most advanced aircraft in its class.

Due to its sophisticated avionics and automation capabilities, the FAA has designated the Sling NGT as a Technically Advanced Airplane (TAA). With the FAA’s recent change in Commercial Pilot requirements, students can now complete their ab-initio training through Private Pilot (PPL) and even their Commercial Pilot check ride in the Sling NGT, as it meets the TAA requirements. This ensures pilots gain valuable experience in managing advanced aircraft systems, preparing them for complex operations in higher-performance aircraft.
